description: "The Eurofighter Typhoon is a multinational twin-engine, canard delta
 wing, multirole fighter. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a highly agile aircraft, designed
 to be a supremely effective dogfighter in combat. Later production aircraft have been
 increasingly better equipped to undertake air-to-surface strike missions and to be
 compatible with an increasing number of different armaments and equipment, including
 Storm Shadow, Brimstone and Marte ER missiles. The type has also taken primary
 responsibility for air-defence duties for the majority of customer nations."
